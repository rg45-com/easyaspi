          Easy as Pi is ready to keep your children safe as this new unprecedented school year starts. We will be taking infrared temperature of everyone when they come in, and no one will be allowed in with a fever. No more than six kids will be allowed at a time in the center. We're offering Ultra Private tutoring hours earlier in the day when no one else will be allowed in the center except one child and one tutor. Plexiglass screen between student and tutor for private sessions and face shields provided for semi-private sessions.
