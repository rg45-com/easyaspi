          <p>This is my second year tutoring at Easy as Pi and I love it!  I love working with kids and I love math.  I'm taking AP BC Calculus this year as well as AP Statistics.  I got a 35 on the math portion of the ACT.  I'm a straight A student and on track to be a valedictorian.  I'm excited to work with your kids to help them improve their grades and increase their knowledge of math!</p>
